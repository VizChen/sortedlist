# sortedlist

A Go library to implement sorted list(This is an implementation of python sortedcontainer in Go). The time complexity of operations:

|Operation|Complexity|
|------|-----|
|Add|O(log(n))|

The time complexity of this algorithms is still O(n) instead of O(log(n)).

- [ ] Implement sorted list(int). 
- [ ] support generic type.
